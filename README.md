We have Tried to create an ECI-Super App. A large number of Youth today is lazy and unaware of the election machinary. We do not like to go through a number of apps and websites just to collect informations. Even though there are a lot of government run apps but people are really unaware of it. So we, have brought each and every possible information related to election process and machinary in one platform. under the slogan of "One nation-One platform for awareness".

## Gamification through leaderboards

It is a great security concern for an individual to reveal whether they have voted or not, so instead of individual leaderboard, we have introduced a gamification feature like "ward-leaderboards" where each ward's voting turnout is measured and a leaderboard is formed in realtime. We have introduced a slogan of **"Apna booth Sbse Mazboot"**. This will motivate the Youth to go and vote so that their ward may be on top in the leaderboard. This creates a competitive spirit among the youth. The youth takes everything as a competition. It is natural for him to compete in order to take their booths up in the leaderboard. 
Also, In future scope, These leaderboards can be used to incentivize the general public of the particular leaderboard as a whole. People will in turn come out to vote in large numbers. 

## Feedback Form

We have introduced feedback forms which are not just feedback forms but are a source of motivating and positive data which common people may share **"completely as per their will"**. They can share their experience, stories, photos and videos in this portal which will create a sense of live interaction and participation. Anyone can Go through the gallery and see the photos and videos. People can read other people's experience and stories, which will in turn increase the voting Legitimacy. This will create a sense of motivation among the people to go to their nearest polling booth to vote, because the environment there is so cheerful.

## Participation of future voters
We have Also introduced a collaboration page, Mock Parliamentary sessions to be conducted in schools, ECI student ambassador programs. We are planning on on boarding students to an extent that they become a part of the election machinary. This will not only create a sense of general awareness among the future voters, but also teach them a lot that is going on in Indian politics. Moreover introducing ECI student ambassador and Polling booth representatives will create an unbiased opinion and environment in the polling booths.

### Other features

We have other features such as Newsletters,
